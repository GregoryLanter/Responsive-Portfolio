                    Hi! I'm a long time developer and a new web developer. I have been programming for 19 years now. 
                    I enjoy the puzzle aspect of programming. It may start a while to get started but once into a issue I quickly get engrossed in solving the problem.
                    I have work in all kinds of offices from big corporate place to smal shops of less than 10 programmers. One of my favorite projects was customing and inatlling barcode software in a warehouse shipping area.

                    I am the youngest of 7 kids and have a wife and kids of my own. I love watching hockey and The Simpsons. The hockey teams I follow are the St. Louis Blues and the Everett Silvertips. 
                    I enjoy traveling I have been to England, Scotland, Italy, Isreal, Jordan and the Philippines and I am planning on going to Germany in 2020!

                    My home office is decorated with Simpsons stuff. My biggest piece of memorabilia is a 6-foot tall fiberglass Homer Simpson.
